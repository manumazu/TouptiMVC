Toupti
~~~~~~

Toupti (pronounced toop-tee) is a micro-framework for PHP5;

I'm not sure what the world needs right now is another framework,
furthermore a PHP micro-framework, but it is a fun experiment. :)

Toupti's goals are modest:
    - don't get in the way
    - be fast
    - be fun


How to start with toupti?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The example/public directory contains an app.php file, and an .htaccess
you can use as templates to setup a local apache vhost.  I recommend
the following directory tree :

    my_new_app/
        public/
            .htaccess
            app.php
        lib/
            toupti.php
        templates/
            a_view_file.php
            another_view.php


And the following Apache vhost should do the trick :

    &lt;VirtualHost toupti&gt;
        ServerName toupti
        ServerAdmin foobar@example.com

        DocumentRoot /path/to/my_new_app/public
        &lt;Directory /path/to/my_new_app/public&gt;
            Options All
            AllowOverride All
            Order deny,allow
            allow from 127.0.0.1
        &lt;/Directory&gt;
    &lt;/VirtualHost&gt;


Ok, but how does it work?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The basics
----------

Toupti is trying to do the right thing -- most of the time; this
does mean that we have to agree on what is the right thing to do.

Toupti works from your existing PHP class, provided it extends the
Toupti class, and then maps all of its public methods to URL paths. 

Let's write the following app.php :

    &lt;?php
    require '../lib/toupti.php';

    class App extends Toupti
    {
        public function index()
        {
            $this-&gt;render(&quot;hello, world!&quot;);
        }
    }

    $toupti = new App();
    $toupti-&gt;run();
    ?&gt;

That's about it, if you've setup a local vhost, accessing http://toupti/
will render the text &quot;Hello, world!&quot;. &quot;index&quot; is the default &quot;root&quot;
action.

If you add another action, to your App class, say :

    public function foobar()
    {
        // ...
    }

Then Toupti will map http://toupti/foobar to this action...


Fun with routing?
-----------------

* The default setup

    Toupti provides a simple, yet flexible routing engine. It is configured
    through the $routes array, that you can (should) override to provide
    better routes in your application.

    The default $routes array is:

        $routes = array(''        =&gt; 'index',
                        ':action' =&gt; ':action');

    The first line maps the path &quot;/&quot; to your action &quot;index&quot;.
    The second line maps the path &quot;/:whatever&quot; to your action &quot;:whatever&quot;.

* Simple named routes

    You can define more complex routes like:

        $routes = array(... ,
                        'say/:what/to/:recipient' =&gt; 'dialogue');

    Which will map &quot;/say/something/to/someone&quot; to the dialogue action.
    Furthermore in dialogue you can access the named parameters through
    the params attribute:

        public function dialogue()
        {
            $this-&gt;params['what'] == 'something';       // true
            $this-&gt;params['recipient'] == 'someone';    // true
        }

    Named parameters must strictly match the alphanumeric regex pattern
    (that is \w for you).


* Routes with splat params

    $routes = array(...,
                    'say/*/to/*' =&gt; 'dialogue');

    This will map any URL starting with &quot;say/&quot; followed
    by other text, followed by &quot;to/&quot;, followed by some more text.

    Every-thing matched in betweem &quot;say&quot; and &quot;to&quot; is push in the
    $this-&gt;params['splat'] array. So :

        For:     /say/rise/to/lord/vader
        You get: $this-&gt;params['splat'] == array('rise', 'lord/vader');

        For:     /say/rise/to/
        You get: $this-&gt;params['splat'] == array('rise', '');

        For:     /say/what/tooooo
        You get: 404 error

        For:     /say/meh/to
        You get: 404 error


* Named routes with custom regexes

    Named routes are fun, but can be too strict at times. What if you
    want to map a numerical ID to your fetch_answer action?

    Well you'd write:

        $routes = array(...,
                        'fetch_answer/:id' =&gt; array('action' =&gt; 'fetch_answer',
                                                    ':id' =&gt; '\d+')
                        );

    So /fetch_answer/42 will lead you to the fetch_answer() action, but
    /fetch_answer/fail will only lead you to a 404 error...


    While we're at it, you can write things like :

        $routes = array(...,
                        'foo/:bar' =&gt; array('action' =&gt; 'do_foo',
                                            ':bar' =&gt; 'bar|baz|quux')
                        );

    To match either of these paths to the 'do_foo' action:
        - /foo/bar
        - /foo/baz
        - /foo/quux


    And since it's only fair that you can also do strange things, it is
    possible to map the route action option to a named param:

        $routes = array(...,
                        'foo/:bar/:baz' =&gt; array('action' =&gt; ':bar',
                                                 ':bar'   =&gt; 'edit|delete',
                                                 ':baz'   =&gt; '\d+')
                        );

    This will map:
        - /foo/edit/42    to the edit   action with params['id'] == 42.
        - /foo/delete/42  to the delete action with params['id'] == 42.



One extremly important thing to remember is that routes are matched from
top to bottom, and that the first that fits is the only one that will
fire.


Action filters
--------------

For each action taken, Toupti looks for filters to call around your
action, so if a route matched the action &quot;frobnitz&quot;, the call chain will
be :

    - before_action
    - before_frobnitz
    - frobnitz
    - after_frobnitz
    - after_action

So yes, having an action named &quot;action&quot; is a silly thing.  Please,
don't.


Templates
---------

Toupti sets a $template directory relative to your main class path, to
hold a few files you want to use as templated documents. The render
method, when given a filename, will search this directory for a PHP file
with that filename, or just render the text you've passed it.

To force the rendering of a file, and the creation of an error if it is
missing, use: render(array('file' =&gt; 'somefile')). All keys of
the array passed to render() will be available in the view through the $v
array.  So you will always get $v['file'] inside a view.


That's about it.  Thank you for reading. :)
